# Climate Change Dashboard

This is a capstone project for **Data Science Project (CS-C3250)** course @Aalto University. The goal of this project was to produce a website that portrays climate change data smoothly to interested view- ers. By using data points from multiple different sources, the site undoubtedly shares the most accurate and up-to- date information we could find. In order to accurately por- tray the effects climate change has had on the planet, we chose to illustrate data of CO2 emissions rising (along with other gases), the ice caps melting, which results in sea levels rising, the rising of temperatures, as well as in- cluded calculations that show how volcanic activity, El Ni√±o, and other factors, are not the primary cause for the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere - but rather it is the human activity that has been the driving force.
