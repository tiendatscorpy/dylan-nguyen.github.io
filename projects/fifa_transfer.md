## Task Details
The task is about finding, using the 'players_21' dataset, the ideal transfers to complete on FIFA 21 Career Mode in order to get the 11 players with the highest overall ratings given a budget constraint of â‚¬ 100M. There are two main tasks:
- A list of player for FIFA 21
- A list of player for FIFA 15, and where they are now in FIFA 21

During the project, I looked at the naive search algorithm, as well as exploring Knapsach search approaches, such as Dynamic Programming as well as Branch and Bound algorithm.
