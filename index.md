[Optimizing Public Transportation With Kafka Streaming](https://confirm.udacity.com/R5HGVA77)

Stack: **REST Proxy, Kafka Connect, KSQL, Apache Avro, Faust Python Stream Processing**

In this Udacity project, I used Kafka and Kafka ecosystem to  stream public transit status using Kafka and the Kafka ecosystem to build a
stream processing application that shows the status of trains in real-time.

[Evaluate Human Balance with Spark Streaming](https://confirm.udacity.com/R5HGVA77)

Stack: **Spark Streaming, Redis, Base64, JSON**

In this Udacity project, I produced a stream of data to a Kafka topic and made it available to the STEDI application to consume. This data is used in a new feature for the application which consist of a graph that shows fall risk (will they fall and become injured?) for recent assessments. The development team has built a graph, which is ready to receive risk information from Kafka.

[COVID-19's impact to Finland Taxi Industry](/projects/thesis)

Stack: **Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Facebook Prophet**

This is my Bachelor Thesis for Data Science Major @Aalto University, where I explored a 14-year dataset of taxi shifts in Finland, in order to trace the impact of COVID-19 pandemics to the taxi industry. Various time series correlation statistics are utilized to estimate the correlation between COVID-19 cases in Finland and taxi revenue data. Furthermore, taxi shift revenue is fitted to a Facebook Prophet model for prediction purpose.


[Climate Change Dashboard With Reaktor](/projects/climate_change)

Stack: **Heroku, Flask, Plotly, Jupyter Notebook, Python**

This is a capstone project for Data Science Project (CS-C3250) course @Aalto University. The aim of this project is to build a data visualization dashboard for environmental data, which can be found [here](https://climate-change-c3250-2020.herokuapp.com/), and applying Machine Learning methodologies to explore the correlation relationship between the rising of temperatures and other environmental variables.


[SQL University Database](/projects/university)

Stack: **SQL, SQLiteStudio**

This is my Capstone project for Database (CS-A1153) course @Aalto University. The aim of this project is to design a SQL database for an university, which contains information about courses, rooms, room reservations, enrollments, and allows numerous SQL operations on the database.
