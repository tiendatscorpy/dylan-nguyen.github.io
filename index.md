Udacity - Optimizing Public Transportation With Kafka Streaming

Stack: **REST Proxy, Kafka Connect, KSQL, Apache Avro, Faust Python Stream Processing**

In this project, I used Kafka and Kafka ecosystem to  stream public transit status using Kafka and the Kafka ecosystem to build a
stream processing application that shows the status of trains in real-time.

Udacity - Evaluate Human Balance with Spark Streaming

Stack: **Spark Streaming, Redis, Base64, JSON**

In this project, I produced a stream of data to a Kafka topic and made it available to the STEDI application to consume. This data is used in a new feature for the application which consist of a graph that shows fall risk (will they fall and become injured?) for recent assessments. The development team has built a graph, which is ready to receive risk information from Kafka.

### Data Science Projects

[COVID-19's impact to Finland Taxi Industry](/projects/thesis)

Stack: **Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Facebook Prophet**

This is my Bachelor Thesis for Data Science Major @Aalto University, where I explored a 14-year dataset of taxi shifts in Finland, in order to trace the impact of COVID-19 pandemics to the taxi industry. Various time series correlation statistics are utilized to estimate the correlation between COVID-19 cases in Finland and taxi revenue data. Furthermore, taxi shift revenue is fitted to a Facebook Prophet model for prediction purpose.

[Climate Change Dashboard With Reaktor](/projects/climate_change)

Stack: **Heroku, Flask, Plotly, Jupyter Notebook, Python**

This is a capstone project for Data Science Project (CS-C3250) course @Aalto University. The aim of this project is to build a data visualization dashboard for environmental data, which can be found [here](https://climate-change-c3250-2020.herokuapp.com/), and applying Machine Learning methodologies to explore the correlation relationship between the rising of temperatures and other environmental variables.

[SQL University Database](/projects/university)

Stack: **SQL, SQLiteStudio**

This is my Capstone project for Database (CS-A1153) course @Aalto University. The aim of this project is to design a SQL database for an university, which contains information about courses, rooms, room reservations, enrollments, and allows numerous SQL operations on the database.

[Football Score Prediction and Classfication](https://github.com/tiendatscorpy/interesting_football/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Report.pdf)

Stack: **Jupyter Notebook, Python, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

This is a capstone project for Data Science (CS-C3160) course @Aalto University. The goal of this project is to predict the total number of goals in football matches and whether the matches are interesting to watch. In attempting to solve this goal prediction problem, I used Linear Regression as well as Polynomial Regression on the training data set, with and without the use of Principle Components Analysis. For the classification problem, I applied K Nearest Neighbours as well as Logistic Regression. The best regression model to predict the total number of goals is Linear Regression, with MSE 1.47 on the test data. Polynomial Regression degree 2 model follows suit with slightly worse MSE 1.51 measure on the test data even though it fits better compared to Linear Regression on the training data. The best classification model to predict whether the match is interesting is Logistic Regression with 67.8% accuracy score, slightly better than KNN with 64.9% accuracy.
