[COVID-19's impact to Finland Taxi Industry](/projects/thesis)

Stacks: **Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Facebook Prophet**

This is my Bachelor Thesis for Data Science Major @Aalto University, where I explored a 14-year dataset of taxi shifts in Finland, in order to trace the impact of COVID-19 pandemics to the taxi industry. Various time series correlation statistics are utilized to estimate the correlation between COVID-19 cases in Finland and taxi revenue data. Furthermore, taxi shift revenue is fitted to a Facebook Prophet model for prediction purpose.

[Climate Change Dashboard With Reaktor](/projects/climate_change)

Stacks: **Heroku, Flask, Plotly, Jupyter Notebook, Python**

This is a capstone project for Data Science Project (CS-C3250) course @Aalto University. The aim of this project is to build a data visualization dashboard for environmental data, which can be found [here](https://climate-change-c3250-2020.herokuapp.com/), and applying Machine Learning methodologies to explore the correlation relationship between the rising of temperatures and other environmental variables.

[SQL University Database](/projects/university)

Stacks: **SQL, SQLiteStudio**

This is my Capstone project for Database (CS-A1153) course @Aalto University. The aim of this project is to design a SQL database for an university, which contains information about courses, rooms, room reservations, enrollments, and allows numerous SQL operations on the database.

[Football Score Prediction and Classfication](https://github.com/tiendatscorpy/interesting_football/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Report.pdf)

Stacks: **Jupyter Notebook, Python, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

This is a capstone project for Data Science (CS-C3160) course @Aalto University. The goal of this project is to predict the total number of goals in football matches and whether the matches are interesting to watch. In attempting to solve this goal prediction problem, I used Linear Regression as well as Polynomial Regression on the training data set, with and without the use of Principle Components Analysis. For the classification problem, I applied K Nearest Neighbours as well as Logistic Regression. The best regression model to predict the total number of goals is Linear Regression, with MSE 1.47 on the test data. Polynomial Regression degree 2 model follows suit with slightly worse MSE 1.51 measure on the test data even though it fits better compared to Linear Regression on the training data. The best classification model to predict whether the match is interesting is Logistic Regression with 67.8% accuracy score, slightly better than KNN with 64.9% accuracy.

[FIFA 21 Most Optimized Transfer Windows](/projects/fifa_transfer)

Stacks: **Pandas, EDA, Search Algorithm, Knapsack Algorithm**

This is my hobby project to utilize search algorithms in order to find the best FIFA 21 players given the budget constraint of 100M euros.
