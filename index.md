[COVID-19's impact to Finland Taxi Industry](/projects/thesis)

Stacks: **Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Facebook Prophet**

This is my Bachelor Thesis for Data Science Major @Aalto University, where I explored a 14-year dataset of taxi shifts in Finland, in order to trace the impact of COVID-19 pandemics to the taxi industry. Various time series correlation statistics are utilized to estimate the correlation between COVID-19 cases in Finland and taxi revenue data. Furthermore, taxi shift revenue is fitted to a Facebook Prophet model for prediction purpose.
